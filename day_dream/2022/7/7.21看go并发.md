## concurrence in go
90分钟 下次从这里开始: http://static.kancloud.cn/mutouzhang/go/596817

### 活锁
程序中模拟的是两个人A,B直面相遇，互相左右礼让，然后一直没有礼让成功，最后两个人一直在那左右移动，始终没有向前走动，这就是活锁

(这个代码的意思一开始还没看太明白...自己理解有点尴尬，翻译也有点让人迷惑)

### 饥饿
感觉这一章可能跟go的版本有很大的关系，因为作者跑出来贪婪的扩大锁粒度，导致会导致polite饥饿。我觉得作者说的很有道理。
- 因为获取锁有代价，3次获取的代价肯定比1次获取高，所以总体来说贪婪的应该执行更多次

FIXED: 但是我跑出来的结果竟然是polite比greedy执行的次数多，很奇怪，windows10的wsl ubuntu18.04，go1.18.1
见 [7.22go并发](./7.22go并发.md)

去Stack Overflow提了一个问题:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73066936/why-i-get-more-count-in-polite-goroutine-than-greedy-goroutine-reading-concurr
When I reading concurrence in go, and I execute the code below and get different results.

Why I get more count in polite goroutine than greedy goroutine?

I'm a freshman in go. I can't get answer in my head. Please help me out of this problem.

my env: windows10 wsl ubuntu18.04

go1.18.1

Stackoverflow is hard to question, It always tell me this: It looks like your post is mostly code; please add some more details.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	var sharedLock sync.Mutex
	const runtime = 1 * time.Second

	greedyWorker := func() {
		defer wg.Done()

		var count int
		for begin := time.Now(); time.Since(begin) <= runtime; {
			sharedLock.Lock()
			time.Sleep(3 * time.Nanosecond)
			sharedLock.Unlock()
			count++
		}

		fmt.Printf("Greedy worker was able to execute %v work loops\n", count)
	}

	politeWorker := func() {
		defer wg.Done()

		var count int
		for begin := time.Now(); time.Since(begin) <= runtime; {
			sharedLock.Lock()
			time.Sleep(1 * time.Nanosecond)
			sharedLock.Unlock()

			sharedLock.Lock()
			time.Sleep(1 * time.Nanosecond)
			sharedLock.Unlock()

			sharedLock.Lock()
			time.Sleep(1 * time.Nanosecond)
			sharedLock.Unlock()

			count++
		}
		fmt.Printf("Polite worker was able to execute %v work loops.\n", count)
	}

	wg.Add(2)
	go greedyWorker()
	go politeWorker()

	wg.Wait()
}
